The third book is a remarkable conclusion to the series, even though I felt the last few chapters were a bit rushed.

After watching the disastrous last few episodes of the Netflix series I went back to reading this book so I would know how the story truly unfolds—and I’m glad I did.&nbsp;<br><br>This book is way better than the first book. Some sections bored me and I found myself skimming through them and some sections I had ""WTF, WOW!"" moments. I ended up liking the latter half of the book. The way the author has constructed this narrative is mind-boggling. Now that I've finished this one, I’m committed to completing the entire series.</div>",,No

I loved reading this book. The novel explores themes of identity, memory, and the human desire to leave a mark on the world. The concept was great, but it did seem to be lacking in parts. The last few chapters were undoubtedly the best. It wasn't as amazing as I initially thought it would be, but it is worthy of a recommendation - a thought-provoking and enjoyable read.</div>",,No
